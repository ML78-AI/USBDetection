# USBDetection

This project is used to detect usb stick and copy paste its content in a new folder.
It only works on linux, I hate Windows and don't know MACOS.
You can remove USB stick during the process, algorithm shouldn't crash but wait for a new USB stick.
I am sure my code isn't optimized but it is my very first project to learn Golang programming language.

I post my code for educational purpose only.
